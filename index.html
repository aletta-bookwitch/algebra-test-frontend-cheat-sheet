        <h1>1. HTML</h1>

        <p>
            Even though our code will least of all consist of HTML, we can't have a web page without it. ^^ <br>
            We need to tell browsers what kind of document they will be loading, and give it some kind of structure...
        </p>
        <h2>Basic HTML document structure</h2>

        <p>
            This part is the "skeleton" of our code, and it looks like this:
        </p>
        
        <pre>

            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
             &lt;html&gt;
              &lt;head&gt;
               <i>(We name it here, and it doesn't show on our page. You can put a <b>title</b> in here, and that will be the tab name. Yay!)</i>
              &lt;/head&gt;
                &lt;body&gt;
                 <b>Some kind of text.</b> <i>(This is what will be shown on the page. Definitely. Unless you hide it somehow. But why would you do that?)</i>
                &lt;/body&gt;
             &lt;/html&gt;
        </pre>

        
        We can form segments of text either by typing it as a <b>paragraph</b>, or make a <b>block</b> of it by turning it into a &lt;div&gt;. <br>
        <br> Like this:
        

        <pre>
        &lt;p&gt;
            Lots of text here. Probably useless, but still fun. At least to someone. You never know who might be reading your page. 
            It could be your cat. You think they're harmless, but believe me, they will rule the world at some point. 
            You can see it in their eyes. The determination. Or it could just be hunger. Who knows.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        </pre>
        Or...
        <pre style="background: lightgrey;">
            
        &lt;div&gt;
            Lots of text here. Probably useless, but still fun. At least to someone. You never know who might be reading your page. 
            It could be your cat. You think they're harmless, but believe me, they will rule the world at some point. 
            You can see it in their eyes. The determination. Or it could just be hunger. Who knows.
        &lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>
